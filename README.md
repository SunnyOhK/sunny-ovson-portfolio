# sunny-ovson-portfolio
Coding portfolio outlining skills I've mastered in 2023 UT EdX Coding Bootcamp.

## Description

The objective for this project ~was to refactor existing HTML code using semantic elements and restructuring the corresponding CSS stylesheet. This allows for the website to have meaning beyond its basic structural layout and provides for a more accessible user experience. This also enhances the browser's ability to read the contents of the webpage and, thus, allows them to better deliver based on user queries.~ 

Key reasons for making a website accessible:
- Reason 1.
- Reason 2.


## Features

- Feature 1.
- Feature 2.
- Feature 3.


## Lessons Learned
TBD
