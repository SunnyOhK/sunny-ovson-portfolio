Coding portfolio outlining skills I've mastered in 2023 UT EdX Coding Bootcamp.

## Description

The objective for this project is to begin creating the foundation for my professional developer portfolio. This first project will set up the framework using advanced CSS techniques to create a fully-responsive environment complete with in-page navigation links, visual readjustments depending on the viewer's screen size, and a structural layout to introduce myself and my work.

Key reasons for making a website accessible:
- Reason 1.
- Reason 2.
